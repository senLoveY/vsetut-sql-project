# vsetut-sql-project
This project was completed as part of the Data Analyst Professional Course at Yandex Practicum.

It aims to design and implement a comprehensive data mart for the “VsyoTut” marketplace and leverage it to address four specific ad hoc analytical business questions. The resulting data mart aggregates user behavior, order history, payment methods, costs, and reviews into a unified analytical view, enabling deeper customer insights and strategic decision-making.
